# Zoho Catalyst Backend Development Rules

## Project Architecture
- This is a **Zoho Catalyst** project, NOT Spring Boot, NOT Express, NOT a servlet container
- Single Java backend entry file: [SkillBridge.java](mdc:functions/SkillBridge/SkillBridge.java)
- SkillBridge.java handles ALL HTTP routing and logic
- Uses Zoho Catalyst Java SDK patterns for requests and responses

## Authentication
- Authentication is handled entirely by **Zoho Catalyst Hosted Authentication**
- **DO NOT** implement login, signup, JWT, sessions, or token validation
- The currently logged-in user must be obtained from the Catalyst request context inside SkillBridge.java
- If a request has no authenticated user, return HTTP 401

## Database
- Database is **Zoho Catalyst Data Store**
- Queries are written using **ZCQL** (Zoho Catalyst Query Language), NOT JDBC SQL
- ZCQL is executed using Catalyst SDK APIs
- **EVERY query must be scoped to the logged-in user using CREATORID**

## Data Model

### Learning Table
- ROWID (primary key)
- CREATORID (auto, user ownership)
- topic (varchar, required)
- category (varchar, required)
- source (varchar, optional)

### AppliedSkill Table
- ROWID (primary key)
- CREATORID (auto)
- learning_id (foreign key → Learning.ROWID)
- type (varchar, required)
- notes (text, optional)

### Relationships
- One Learning → Many AppliedSkill
- AppliedSkill always belongs to exactly one Learning

## Important Constraints
- **DO NOT** assume generic SQL, ORM, or framework behavior
- **ALWAYS** use Catalyst SDK–specific APIs and patterns
- All database operations must filter by CREATORID to ensure user data isolation
